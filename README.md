# Samsung WiFi Audio integration with Smarthings

This integration controls Samsung WiFi Speakers and Soundbars with "Multiroom" capabilities  It has been tested on the Samsung HS-MS650 Soundbar and the R1 Speaker.  It is expected to run on any of the Samsung Multiroom compatible speakers.

# Capabilities

a.  Music playback control

b.  Device control (volume, mute, audio source, equalizer preset)

c.  8 Presets.  Ability to set-up and then call up presets for channel or music playback.

d.  3 Group Presets per speaker.

e.  Audio Notification in accordance with the SmartThings Capability

f.  Play Text functions with the ability to define voice for speakers and older soundbars.

This device handler for SmartThings integration was completed using the commands from Port 55001, as defined at the site "https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/samsung_shape".  My appreciation for the many participants in that effort for their instrumental research and discoveries.
